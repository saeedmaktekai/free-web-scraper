# Web Scraper Project

This project is a simple web scraper. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   Before you install the necessary packages, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install the Required Packages:**

   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Scraper:**

   After the packages are installed, you can run the web scraper by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python loader.py
   ```

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure that your `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies for the project.
- Modify `loader.py` as needed to scrape data from your desired sources.
