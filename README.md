# 🌐 Web Scraper Project

Welcome to the Web Scraper Project! This tool is designed to efficiently scrape data from web sources, making your data collection tasks easier and more automated. Follow the guide below to get started quickly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To ensure all dependencies are neatly contained, start by creating a virtual environment. This keeps your project dependencies isolated and your system clean.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the environment to start working within your project’s isolated setup.

- **For macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **For Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Required Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Web Scraper

You’re all set to start scraping! Run the `loader.py` script to execute the web scraper:

```bash
python loader.py
```

## 🛠️ Deactivate the Virtual Environment

After completing your tasks, deactivate the virtual environment to return to your global Python environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## 📝 Additional Information

- **Customization:** Feel free to modify `loader.py` to tailor the scraper to your specific needs.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
